# 🌤️ India Climate Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **India Climate Dashboard** is an interactive Power BI project designed to explore, analyze, and communicate daily climate patterns across India between **2013 and 2017**.  

The goal of this project was not only to analyze weather data, but to **translate raw climate metrics into an intuitive, app-like dashboard experience** that mirrors modern weather applications while remaining analytically sound.

This project emphasizes **data storytelling, UX-focused design, and analytical clarity**, making complex environmental data accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Transform raw historical climate data into meaningful insights
- Simulate a **real-world weather application UI** using Power BI
- Practice advanced Power BI concepts:
  - DAX measures
  - Custom tooltips
  - Gauges and KPI cards
  - Interactive slicers
- Demonstrate strong **data visualization and UX intuition**
- Balance analytical accuracy with **clarity and usability**

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains **daily climate observations** across India from **2013–2017**, including:

- Date (Year, Month, Day)
- Mean Temperature (°C)
- Humidity (%)
- Wind Speed (km/h)
- Atmospheric Pressure (hPa)

Additional metrics such as **“Feels Like” temperature, visibility, and UV index** were derived or approximated to enhance interpretability and replicate real weather dashboards.

> ⚠️ Note: Some values (e.g., UV Index, Visibility, Feels Like) are **modeled for visualization and UX purposes**, prioritizing realism over exact scientific precision.

## 🧠 Key Features & Design Choices

### 🌡️ Temperature & “Feels Like”
- Displays both actual mean temperature and perceived temperature
- Designed to mimic consumer weather apps
- “Feels Like” value responds dynamically to slicers

### 🌬️ Wind Status
- Histogram visualization shows wind speed distribution
- Provides insight into variability rather than a single average

### ☀️ UV Index Gauge
- Custom gauge built to represent UV exposure risk
- Uses intuitive thresholds (low → high)
- Focused on quick visual interpretation

### 💧 Humidity & Visibility
- KPI cards paired with descriptive text
- Contextual messaging (e.g., haze, dew point influence)
- Designed for instant comprehension

### 🌅 Sunrise & Sunset
- Average sunrise and sunset times displayed
- KPI-style layout for clarity
- Enhances realism of the weather experience

### 📌 Tooltips
- Custom tooltip pages provide deeper insight on hover
- Reduces clutter while preserving detail
- Improves storytelling without overwhelming the user

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Power BI Desktop**
- DAX (calculated measures & KPIs)
- Custom tooltip pages
- Interactive slicers
- UX-first dashboard layout
- Dark theme design for readability and contrast

## 📐 UX & Visualization Philosophy
This project intentionally prioritizes:
- **Clarity over density**
- **Visual hierarchy**
- **Minimal cognitive load**
- **App-like familiarity**

Rather than building a traditional analytical report, the dashboard is designed as a **decision-friendly interface**, allowing users to quickly assess weather conditions and trends.

## 📈 Key Insights
- Seasonal temperature patterns vary significantly across months
- Perceived temperature often diverges from actual temperature
- UV exposure risk peaks during mid-year months
- Higher humidity frequently correlates with reduced visibility
- Wind speed distributions reveal more nuance than simple averages

---

## 🚀 How to Interact
1. Use **Year** and **Month** slicers to explore trends
2. Hover over KPI cards to reveal custom tooltips
3. Observe how metrics dynamically respond to filters
4. Compare seasonal changes across years
